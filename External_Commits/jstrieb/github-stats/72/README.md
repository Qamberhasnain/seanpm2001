I am a programming language collector. This may seem like a crazy question, but is there a way to display ALL languages in `languages.svg` instead of just the top 13? It seems to have picked up all the languages I wanted it to, they just don't all show, not even as `other %`
(yes, I know a lot of lag would be involved, I am just wondering if it is possible)
