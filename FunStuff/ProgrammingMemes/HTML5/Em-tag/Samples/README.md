# `<em>` tag meme

## 2021 Thursday November 18th

_This meme was written in Gentoo, you have to compile it yourself._

<!-- No !-->
```html
<b><i>Sample text</i></b>
```

<!-- Yes !-->
```html
<em>Sample text</em>
```

**Context:** _Today, I was pondering what the point was in using the em tag and I was looking at the source code of a GitHub release discussion. I have noted that the `<em>` tag is more useful in combining multiple text formats in one. I will try to use it more from now on. I quickly put together this meme in less than 15 minutes._

# Error

I have noted that this meme is inaccurate less than half an hour after making it. The `<em>` tag only italizes content, and does <b>NOT</b> bold it. Here is the corrected meme, I will leave it to the community to fix this if needed.

<!-- No !-->
```html
<p><i>Sample text</i></p>
```

<!-- Yes !-->
```html
<em>Sample text</em>
```

**Context:** _This meme was made with GIMP 2.10.28. I am sorry about it not looking good, I am still learning, and this one was a bit rushed. I couldn't resize the layers, and I couldn't crop them, as I made this in a rush. You can improve on it if needed._
