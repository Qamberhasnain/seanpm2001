# What are these called?

I have been trying to figure out what these file attributions are called (as of August 2021) I am not talking about the README.markdown files or the plain text (PLAIN_TEXT.txt) files, I don't know what these other files are known as.

They don't have an extension, but their unique name indicates that they are designed for a special purpose, but are still recognized as text files. I am wondering, for example, what it is called when an icon is applied to a file with the name `CREDITS` is it UNIX-specific?

## Extra notes

The screenshot used for reference was taken by snipping with GNOME Screenshot, and in the process, `GNOME-SHELL` broke. The close, minimize, and maximize buttons became dysfunctional, and I couldn't launch/unminimize programs through the dock, but everything else was functional. I saved my work and restarted, as I didn't know how to manually restart the GNOME shell.

I am using the `*.markdown` extension for this file, as I have never used it before.
