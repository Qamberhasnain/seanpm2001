### Status update: May 7th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `18` _(as of May 7th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

I had a decent day with development today. 


I stayed up pretty late, I was in a rush with the last hour of my day after procrastinationg a lot.

I created 7 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal, but I am now expecting it to drag on to May 21st 2021 or further.

Today, I mostly did documentation-related work. I didn't do any full-on programming today. My laptop has been incredibly unstable lately, and this has been an issue for 2 different laptops now (one Windows and one Ubuntu) and I am working on narrowing the issue down and getting it down to a science, but it is difficult, as it is related to bad drivers, and there are over 80 different factors of what it could be. Here is my current listing:

```ruby

```

I chose Ruby, as it highlights each entry with yellow text for the first word when capitalized (as of Gedit) 

Due to all these new topics/projects/Organizations, I have been doing a lot more forks. I have had another shorter forking frenzy today. Today I worked on the organization description repository and standardized it. Recently, GitHub added support for the Git `fetch-upstream` command, which will be very useful in the future for all these organizations of mine and their projects.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a decent day for development
