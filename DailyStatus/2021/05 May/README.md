### Daily status - May 2021

This is the daily status thread for May 2021. Daily status posts will be put daily (or when I get to it) below this post.

<!-- A little update for now (2 months old): I feel a lot more organized compared to December 2020, but these status posts still prove to be useful. Again, this is not how GitHub issues are meant to be used on programming projects, but for personal projects like a GitHub profile repository, it is perfectly acceptable.
