### Daily status - 2022 January

This is the daily status thread for 2022 January. Daily status posts will be put daily (or when I get to it) below this post.

<!-- A little update for now (4 months old): I feel a lot more organized compared to December 2020, but these status posts still prove to be useful. Again, this is not how GitHub issues are meant to be used on programming projects, but for personal projects like a GitHub profile repository, it is perfectly acceptable.

I have really been falling behind this month. It is January 12th, and I haven't gotten a single entry completed yet (as of 5:26 pm) but I am working on it. I plan to try again tonight/this evening.
