I had an OK day with development today. The month started disorganized, and I hope it gets better. I wanted to stay caught up until January 1st, but it all fell apart in a power outage on 2021 December 27th/28th, and the amount of work I am behind in is just piling up. I am still very far behind today. I have lots planned, but I just continue to fall behind.

I have been working on a super verbose task for over a week, which is setting up the `all-contributors` bot and archiving the setup data, posts, and replies. It is one of the most verbose issue archival tasks I have worked on to date. I have recently decided to stop this project, as I found it was eating up far too much time, and needed to be automated.

Today, I was focused on several things again. I did limited Git-image work, and got caught up on battery documentation image uploads, worked heavily on my Raspberry Pi blog, and my first GitHub image repo. I also published the idea for the `DeciCube` an experimental max density storage device ranging in the billions to trillions of dollars in cost, but with the ability to store over 500 thousand copies of the entire 2021 Internet on a single brick of data. This project is named so, as it can hold over a decillion bytes of data, and is in the shape of a giant cube. It is considered max density, as every Silicon atom is used for storage, with an estimated 108 atoms being needed per byte of data. I can't manufacture one myself, obviously, but max density storage devices have been an interest of mine for a couple years now, and this is the second practical example I have come up with. It requires meeting the limits of Moores Law to build, and there is no way to make it more compact until we can find out how to make atoms smaller, or something similar, if that is even possible (maybe there is something smaller in scale to an atom)

I had time to use my Raspberry Pi for audio conversion today, and I continuously tried to get caught up. I had one of my repositories hit 10K commits for the first time today (`SeansLifeArchive_Images_GitHub`) and I dealt with further keyboard failures, with the `1`, `2`, `3`, and `prnt scrn (F10)` keys failing. Today was also the climax of my CPU fan failure, the fan itself sounding like it was made from paper today. The next day (and as of writing this on 2022, Thursday, February 10th) it has had no further issues, and doesn't even go to a support assistant screen upon boot anymore... for now.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
