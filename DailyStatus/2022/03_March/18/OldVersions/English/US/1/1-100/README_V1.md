<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

Glitch regarding forks not rendering in a proper list

Falling behind on some tasks (naming image files, battery images, DDS, KA Images, RPI Status, activity files, MB, DDG IMG)

Working on mental and physical health
Mass forks again today, have to manually add `/fork` to the URL due to list compilation error

I had a decent day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

Today was the day of the week where I did GitHub organization work. I created the 10 organizations much faster than expected, and also documented them quickly. I finished about 3-5 hours earlier than planned. My laptop has also been highly stable for the past 4 days.

Today, I had a little scare over the error message `This repository is disabled` coming up for a few seconds (before reloading) instead of the usual `404` error.

GitHub seems to have done some updates behind the scenes, and it caused a glitch that causes forking a project to not render in a proper list, and it is not good for someone with more than 20 orgs. I had to constantly type out `/fork` to the end of the URL due to the error today during mass forks. An obscure but useful feature was added back, which was the blue highlight and mouse status for hovering over entries in the GitHub calendar such as `created x commits in x repositories`

I fell behind on some tasks today, such as naming image files, battery images, Daily Desktop Screenshots, Khan Academy Images, and Raspberry Pi Status/blog notes. I also fell further behind on activity files, Marine Biology notes, and DuckDuckGo calculation data. I did get caught up on my Bi-daily Git-image work. My schedule has recently shifted from a daily schedule to a bi-daily schedule, so tonight, I worked on my journal, instead of getting caught up on the above listed tasks.

I am also trying to focus work on my mental and physical health, which has been declining lately.

I hope to get caught up on the other 2 projects today. I have lowered the status of Git-template uploads, as the task is now considered too easy to list as a major entry, and I want to increase my morale on getting caught up.

Here are the last 2 projects I have left:

```text
The last 2

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2. GitHub Activity files
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
