<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

I had an OK day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

I fell behind on most Git-image work, along with activity logs and status post work today. I was really distracted, and the time I had left had to go to my journal.

I worked further on the TOML IDE project today, it now adheres to both the MIT and GPL licenses. I want to use MIT as infrequently as possible, so this is why I partition projects so that MIT dependant features can work, and the rest can be an actual good license. The #1 cause of open source developer burnout is the problems that licenses like the MIT license cause. They allow for a hostile corporate takeover, among other legal issues. In a more perfect world, more people would be using the GPL license, as that is exactly what it was designed to prevent: it fixes almost all the problems that most other licenses cause. Maybe the verbosity of the license text (over 660 lines, about 35 kilobytes), or the term "copyleft" is throwing people off, it is a very good and strong license.

I also resumed work on the MCPYE project today, but mostly did basic documentation updates. I added 15 project language files to my audio database project today, which took over 2 hours, but now there is nothing new I can currently add to the project, so it is up to date as a model project.

Additionally, I did the usual once every 2 days Git-image work, which slowed me down tonight.

I hope to get caught up on the last project(s) another day. I have lowered the status of Git-template uploads, as the task is now considered too easy to list as a major entry, and I want to increase my morale on getting caught up.

Here is the last project(s) I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
