I had a very good day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

Today, I did the usual Git-image and daily documentation work, along with the once-every-2 days Git-image work. I did mass `IGNORE.md` file deletion in the `GitHUb images` repository, which alongside a structural change in the `GitHub Organization Info` repository, I nearly reached 500 commits for today, and significantly raised the bar.

Alongside image documentation work, I didn't do much. I did some programming work offline, on a voice software that I am experimenting with. I also had a lot of general downtime today due to the other mentioned projects, along with the following 100 organizations project. This voice software is planned to be made public on 2022, Friday, April 8th. I experimented with it today, and found that CSound and Perl just aren't doable for what I am doing, and Python was chosen. I try not to use Python for everything due to software diversity reasons.

I spent a lot of time getting caught up on my journaling tonight, this caused me to stay up much later tonight, and wake up much later tomorrow. I have still not resumed the marine biology documentation project.

I have stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She really seems like she will until her 15th birthday. She has not been in pain for almost a week and is doing significantly better for the time.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
