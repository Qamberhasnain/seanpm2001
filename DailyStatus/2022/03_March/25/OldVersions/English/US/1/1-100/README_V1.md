<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

<!-- Notes 2022.03.25
2022 Wednesday March 25th status notes

Milly still doing OK, still not much longer in her life
GitHub organization development day, 10 new orgs
Despite multiple days of preparation, it still took a long time to complete
Private marine biology project started, won't be revealed until 2022 June or 2022 July (there is a chance I can shuffle things around and release it in 2022 April or 2022 May)
Social life not doing well
Basic Git-image work, falling behind on status post work
100 orgs followed
Too many tabs

-->

I had an OK day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

Today was the day of the week week where I created 10 new organization projects. Despute multiple days of preparation, it still took a long time to complete.

I started a set of semi-private marine biology projects today, they won't bel fully revealed until 2022 June or 2022 July, although there is a chance that if I shuffle my todo list, I could release it in 2022 April or 2022 May.

My social life hasn't been doing too well lately. I am not getting out enough.

I did basic Git=image work, but fell behind on status post work. I followed 100 more organizations today, and dealt with a continued growing Firefox tab nightmare (almost at 200-400 tabs)

I have stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is doing OK today, but there unfortunately is still not much longer to go in her life.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
