<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

I had a good day with developmen today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

Today was my 21st birthday. Unfortunately, I didn't celebrate it too much, I just didn't feel like doing so today. I got less than 8 hours of sleep last night, so I was drowsy and weak today. However, I did get fully caught up on GitHub activity file documentation, it took nearly 5 hours, but I completed 66 logs (2022 January 14th to 2022 March 20th) now all that is left is the marine biology data, along with the 2 sub-tasks, then I will be completely caught up.

I did not stay caught up on some Git-image work today, as I didn't have enough remaining time or energy for it, but I stayed up to date on some of it. I still wanted to reach 14,700 commits today, so I worked on the SNU TOML IDE project, which is now my first and only project to have TOML as a majority language.

I received a `birthday present` from GitHub today, which was the ability to follow organizations. This has been requested by the GitHub community for a while now, and I have been waiting for it since 2020. It finally got added today, but I am not sure what to do with it yet. It is missing some functionality I would like, which is the ability to see who is following an organization. I feel like that is going to be added at some point (possibly soon) but I don't know when.

There is also now a `for you` activity feed, which isn't very good at the moment, but I don't really use the activity feed too much to begin with, but I do use the repository search and discovery features. I feel those will remain the same, and I am sure someone will create a browser extension to fix the problem if it really is that bad.

I hope to get caught up on the last project(s) another day. I have lowered the status of Git-template uploads, as the task is now considered too easy to list as a major entry, and I want to increase my morale on getting caught up.

Here is the last project(s) I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
