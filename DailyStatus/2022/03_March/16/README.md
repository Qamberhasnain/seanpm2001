<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

I had very good day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

Today, I got all caught up on status post work. There was an Internet outage where I live that happened for over 1 hour. It really helped, as it got rid of most distractions, and I was able to get caught up on this 1 project. I was going to start work on activity files as well, but I found out I am much further behind on that than I expected (I expected it to only be behind by a month, but it hasn't been updated since 2022 January 13th)

I did mass forks today, and got caught up on several projects. I fell behind on deleting `IGNORE.md` files from the GitHub image repo, along with naming image files. I had to skip them, as I needed to get caught up on my daily journal tonight.

St. Patricks Day is tomorrow. I have been opened up to criticism of the way it is commonly celebrated in the Americas, but I never really celebrated the holiday too much to begin with. I am Irish myself (but never developed an Irish accent) but based on what I am reading, I am likely 2nd generation Irish, or "English"

I have started to use Emojis in file names today, I kind of like doing it. I will start doing it publicly on GitHub, but I won't do it excessively.

I did my Git-image part A worm today, which has now been limited to once every 2 days. I also slightly updated the Git-Templates repository, and created a model project info repository for info regarding model projects.

I hope to get caught up on the other 2 projects today. I have lowered the status of Git-template uploads, as the task is now considered too easy to list as a major entry, and I want to increase my morale on getting caught up.

Here are the last 2 projects I have left:

```text
The last 2

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2. GitHub Activity files
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
