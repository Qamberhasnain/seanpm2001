<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

Breaking the weekly goal of not taking any new projects on, too many strikes
Trying to just take on small projects
Over an hour and 10 minutes spent on the new ReStructuredText sandbox repo to learn a few things that were needed in some external notes
The new "What SNU will never do" article/code of conduct repository
Some forks
Some work on the 360Desktop project
Staying caught up on several projects
Catching up onmy Raspberry Pi blog project

I had a good day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

Today, I again broke the weekly goal of not taking any new projects on, there has been too many strikes on this goal. I have at least tried to take on smaller projects instead.

Today, I spent over an hour and 10 minutes on the new ReStructuredText sandbox repository, so that I could learn 5 things to apply to some external notes (which are part of the GitHub Organization Project, and won't be ready until at least 2022 June or 2022 July)

I also worked a little bit on the `What SNU will never do` article/code of conduct project, and did some forks. I also did some work on the 360Desktop project.

I stayed caught up on several projects again today, and got caught up on my Raspberry Pi blog project. Additionally, I finalized the 2022 Volume 2 Tree World image repository, and did very brief Git-image work today. 

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
