<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

Commits lost, unknown what happened, dropped below 17k for the year
Preparing for tomorrow
Another day of mass follows, 99x
Staying caught up
Woke up really late
Work on private projects
Private projects planned to go public in 8 days (2022, Friday, April 8th)
GitHub still shows commits on my activity as private commits for projects that used to be private, but are no longer private (such as IsraeLinux and Teams) which is odd.
North Korea research project
Finally learning the proper way of writing GetText Catalogs
Very brief MoonScript and Lua programming today

I had an OK day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

Today, there was a loss of commits upon checking GitHub. I didn't receive an email or a notification, which was extremely unhelpful. I couldn't figure out what happened to 50-60 of my commits for this year. I reached 17000 commits for this year a second time today due to this. I would like to know what happened.

Today, I did another day of mass organization follows, doing 99 follows on organizations, and 1 follow for follow action. I woke up really late today, but I stayed caught up today. I worked on private projects again today, the projects are planned to go public in 8 days (on 2022, Friday, April 8th) GitHub still shows commits on my activity as private commits for projects that used to be private, but are no longer private (such as IsraeLinux and Teams) which is odd.

I have been working on a North Korea research project today, putting lots of work into its documentation and structure, and doing a brief amount of Lua and MoonScript programming. Note that I do not intend to hack North Korea (I would like to, but I have too much at risk)

I stayed caught up on the usual Git-image work today. I also worked on 1 other project, a joke program project that will be released publicly on 2022, Friday, April 8th.

Today, I finally figured out the proper way to write GetText Catalog files.

I have stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She really seems like she will until her 15th birthday. She is most likely going to make it to her 15th birthday, which is tomorrow (2022, April 1st) she has been doing a lot better, and has had no recent health scares since last mentioned.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
