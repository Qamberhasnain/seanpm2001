<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

<!-- Notes 2022.03.26
2022 Wednesday March 26th status notes

Milly still doing OK, still not much longer in her life, will keep logging her status
Trying to get caught up again
Private marine biology project started in more depth, won't be revealed until 2022 June or 2022 July (there is a chance I can shuffle things around and release it in 2022 April or 2022 May)
Social life not doing well
Laptop stall
Laptop hardware issue, loud buzzing sound for 5 seconds that sounded like a balloon getting untied and spazzing out around the room (in short: balloon deflation sound)
Caught up on RPI blog
Basic Git-image work, falling behind on status post work further
101 orgs followed, 1 extra by accident
Too many tabs, opening and closing Firefox over 10 times today due to nearly 300 tabs being open, and the device not handling it for more than an hour, will move on to the next profile on Sunday/Monday
Trying to get caught up on my journaling tonight
Still unable to make progress on Marine Biology notes
Solid State drive backup today
Once every 2 days Git-image work
Catching up on activity file work, still not uploading the notes yet (laptop crashed yesterday 7 days into note preparation, the source folder had over 6000 files at root)

-->

I had an OK day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

I tried to get caught up again today on what I already had been working on. My social life is doing worse, and there is a stall on laptop repair/replacement. Additionally, my laptop made a loud buzzing sound for 5 seconds that sounded like a mixture of a saw and a balloon deflating. I later identified the issue to be the laptop fan.

I got caught up on my Raspberry Pi blog today, and did Gi-image work, but falling behind on my status post work. I accidentally followed an extra organization today (101 instead of 100) and I didn't feel like going back, but instead to go with it.

I have been experimenting with Firefox tabs recently, and this weeks profile has so many tabs (it feels like there is between 200-400+ tabs open) it takes the browser a minute and a half to load, and due to a memory issue with this version of Firefox on Ubuntu, it eats up significant amounts of memory quickly, and needs to be restarted (closed and re-opened) every 30-60 minutes. I went to the next weeks profile a day early due to this issue.

Tonight, I worked on getting caught up on my journaling. I am still not making progress on Marine Biology notes.

I did a solid state drive backup today, and completed bi-daily Git-imahge work. I began to get caught up on activity file work, but I still have not uploaded the files yet. My laptop crashed 7 days (worth of notes) in, due to the source folder having over 6000 files at root.

I have stalled on trying to get all the way caught up. Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Milly is still doing OK, I will keep logging her status here. She may be able to last until her 15th birthday.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
