<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

<!-- Notes 2022.03.07
2022 March 7th

Excessive and useless work on Wiki archive projects
Staying caught up on several projects
SNU BrowserNose work
DDS catchup

Time wasted on unnecessary WIki prep work
Weak development day
Mass forks for 3+ hours
Trying to not take on any new projects for a week
!-->

I had a weak day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

Today, I created a Wiki archive for the BrowserNose project, and did excessive and useless work on 2 Wiki archive projects. If the SNU BrowserNose Wiki had more than 2 pages (if it had at least 50 pages) I wouldn't consider it as bad. ALthough I still managed to stay caught up on several projects, and also worked on the SNU BrowserNose project. I also got caught up with the Daily Desktop Screenshots repository.

I also wasted time on mass project forks for 3 hours. I have been trying to not take on any new projects for a week, but it has proven very difficult.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
