<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

<!-- Notes 2022.03.24
2022 Wednesday March 24th status notes

1.5x the normal amount of `IGNORE.md` file deletion
Milly doing a bit better, still not much longer in her life
Getting caught up and staying caught up on some Git-image work
Further preparations in getting ready for making this Friday even quicker than last Friday in the organization process
No technical issues today
No progress in getting caught up on marine biology or note uploads
Up to 2k follows, followed another 100 organizations today
Plans to follow a minimum of 14 more tomorrow, most likely another 100
So many programming languages
Growing more critical of the GitHub for you feed. I feel that it might become a "not optional" thing. GitHub doesn't need something like this. I don't want GitHub to become the Instagram of social programming websites. At least in comparison, it is a lot better, as there aren't any notable dark patterns, and the kind of stuff you see isn't that bad when compared to Reddit or Instagram, as there aren't image or video posts... oh no... don't even think about it Microsoft.

I had an OK day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th

I did mass forks today, along with documentation, taking an extra day to prepare for Friday. My laptop also crashed today, it had a bug where every text box my mouse hovered over became glitched and overwrote the contents with 

```
e=
```

I lost some work, but was able to remake it. My system seems to hate editing HTML or XML-based languages. I thought it was limited to just Gedit, but it is apparently system-wide. I can't even edit a file with the HTML extension (with syntax highlighting set to anything else, eg: Plain Text, ActionScript) without running the risk of crashing. It has been like this for most of my time with Ubuntu, and it is very frustrating. Unfortunately, the issue seems to apply to Markdown too, as Markdown supports HTML elements.

I continued to make use of the ability to follow GitHub organizations today, following exactly 100 and doing further documentation. The documentation is what caused my system to crash, maybe it was because I was doing nested `<details>` tags, 4 layers deep.

I hope to get caught up on the last project(s) another day. I have lowered the status of Git-template uploads, as the task is now considered too easy to list as a major entry, and I want to increase my morale on getting caught up. I had on and off gaming sessions, and worked on getting caught up again, very slowly.

I did partial mass `IGNORE.md` file deletion, only doing half the normal amount. I stayed caught up on the usual Git-image work, and made progress on the structure of my Raspberry Pi blog. I am nearly all caught up.

Here is the last project I have left:

```text
The last projects

1. Marine Biology
1A. DuckDuckGo data (likely a single commit)
2A. Git-Templates notes uploads
```

Today was a depressing day personally, as our eldest dog Milly (a nearly 15 year old Miniature Shnauzer) is in worsening health (she has been suffering from diabetes for months, is nearly completely blind, and is now starting to go into severe pain) unfortunately, it is getting close to the decision to put her down, she might not make it to her 15th birthday. We can't let her live in pain, however. We are going to see if she is doing better tomorrow, we have been having massive scares like this every 1-2 weeks, but she doesn't have much time left, and it is going to be very painful for all of us when she passes.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
