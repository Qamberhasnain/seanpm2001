### Daily status - 2022 May

This is the daily status thread for 2022, May. Daily status posts will be put daily (or when I get to it) below this post.

<!-- A little update for now (4 months old): I feel a lot more organized compared to December 2020, but these status posts still prove to be useful. Again, this is not how GitHub issues are meant to be used on programming projects, but for personal projects like a GitHub profile repository, it is perfectly acceptable.

Starting on 2022 January 14th, entries have gone back to their shortened form. This was done to save time, memory, and prevent unnecessary duplication. I hope to get caught up by February 14th, then stay caught up.
