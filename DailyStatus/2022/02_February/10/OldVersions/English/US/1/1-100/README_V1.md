<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

Status post work
Starting later
Tree World Volume 2 modernized, skipped archival of all-contributor issue and PR data to save time
Git-Template V8 work brief
Git-image work
Raspberry Pi blog
Vim AutoScroller

I had a pretty good day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th.

Today I worked on a few projects. I started a bit later in the day today.

I modernized my Tree World volume 2 reposotyr, skipping the archival of the all-contributor issue, Pull requests, and related data in order to save time. I briefly worked on my V8 template, and did limited Git-image work. I kept my Raspberry Pi up tOo date, and did some forks regarding newly discovered languages. I also created a new project today known as Vim AutoScroller, which is my first program that is written entirely in Vim Script. I am surprised that no-one thought of this until now. I have had the idea for a couple days, and decided to bring it to light. The program automatically scrolls documents in the Vim Text editor at a user defined pace.

Today, I got all caught up on status post work, thanks to the reduced workload, and devotion of time to it. I got nearly a month worth (2022 January 15th to 2022 February 10th) of status posts created within 4 hours of time. If I had done it the other way, it would have taken several days. I now hope to stay up to date on my main daily journal as well as the status posts for GitHub.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
