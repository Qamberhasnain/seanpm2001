<!--_I have noted that GitHub rounds up the total number of each statistic, so when something reaches 50 after the kilo point (once it reaches 1000) it rounds up to the next kilo, so 1050 would be 1100, 1150 would be 1200, and so on._

<!-- Notes 2022.02.23
Work on Linux Defender

AUTOMATE2001 Beacons
Trying to catch up
Off day
!-->

I had an off day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th.

I worked a lot on Linux Defender, and began creating themes for the project, along with placing AUTOMATE2001 "Beacons" (the `AUTOMATE2001.yml` file) across various projects. I didn't make much progress in getting caught up, which is why it was an off day

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
