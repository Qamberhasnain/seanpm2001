Mass Git-image and SNU Web-IDE work
Some forks
Staying caught up on several projects
Catching up on my Raspberry Pi blog
Solidity: address usage
!-->

I had a very good day with development today. I am still struggling to stay caught up, but I am slowly getting there. It has been a struggle since 2021 December 28th.

I did mass amounts of Git-image work, along with work on 5 different SNU Web-IDE projects, along with the core SNU Programming Tools repository. I did some forks, and stayed caught up on several projects. I also caught up on my Raspberry Pi Blog project today.

Today with SNU Programming Tools, I finally found a dual licensing scheme that works. The project has been separated into different parts, and there is a markdown license that describes what components are under what license (I still intend to use the GNU General Public License V3.0 whenever possible, with the exception of the UNLICENSE, which I want to use as well. It is being applied to older/obscure languages, such as Orwell, COBOL, etc.) the APACHE license was overwritten with this license guide, and a copy of the APACHE license was moved and renamed and is still at the root of the repository.

I need to address my usage of Solidity today: I am not too familiar with the language, and it may get just a one time usage on the SNU Programming Tools project, and also the Code Distancing project. I am against NFTs, as I see them as a form of DRM. I am not entirely against cryptocurrency yet, as there may be environmentally friendly ways of using and creating them. Solidity is being used, because the goal of SNU Programming Tools is to support every programming language.

## Move note

Data has been moved on the 2022 February 8th revision, which started with the 2022 January 14th entry post. It was too difficult to maintain, and not worth maintaining. Data will need to be moved to subprojects. Data from 2022 January 13th and below contain all the uncut data.

The following major data was omitted:

- Counters (commented out)

- Language knowledge sections (Java, JavaScript, etc.)

- All other subsections

The data was mostly being duplicated with little change, occupying unnecessary space. I have now gone back to the classic way of writing status posts. It should reduce the writing time per day from ~20+ minutes to <5 minutes.
