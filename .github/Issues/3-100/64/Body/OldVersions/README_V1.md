# Description
As it can be seen in [Readme](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/README.md) file. Third github-readme-stats is showing an error and the reason behind it is that either you haven't signed up on https://wakatime.com/ or you are not using wakatime's username in link instead I saw you used GitHub's username but it was clearly mentioned by [@anuraghazara](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#wakatime-week-stats). 

# Possible solution
You would have to login or signup for wakatime and complete you profile there then only you can use this feature in you readme file.
